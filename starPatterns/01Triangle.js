Pattern 7 - Print a Right-Angled Triangle of Alternating 1s and 0s
Write a program that prints a triangle of alternating 1s and 0s starting with 1 on each row.

Example Output (n = 4)

1
10
101
1010
  
Approach
Outer Loop (Rows): Loop i from 0 to n - 1.
Initialize toggle = 1: Start each row with toggle = 1.
Inner Loop (Columns): For each row, loop j from 0 to i. On each iteration:
Append toggle to the row string.
Flip toggle between 1 and 0.
Print Row: After inner loop, print the row string.
Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
Space Complexity: O(n) per row

    for(let j = 0; j < i+1; j++){
        row = row + toggle+ " "
        // switch the toggle
        if(toggle === 1){
            toggle = 0
