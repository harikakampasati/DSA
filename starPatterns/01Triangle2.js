Pattern 8 - Right-Angled Triangle of Alternating 1s and 0s (Global Toggle)
Write a program to print a triangle of alternating 1s and 0s, but the toggle continues globally across rows.

Output (n = 4)

1
01
010
1010
  
Approach
Global Toggle Variable: Declare toggle = 1 before the outer loop.
Outer Loop: Loop i from 0 to n - 1.
Inner Loop: Loop j from 0 to i. On each iteration:
Append toggle to the row string.
Flip toggle: 1 → 0 and 0 → 1.
Print the row after the inner loop.
Key Difference
In the previous pattern, toggle = 1 was reset each row. Here, the toggle continues globally across the entire pattern.

Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(n) per row
